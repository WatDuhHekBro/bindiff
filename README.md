# bindiff
This is a lightweight command line tool that scans for files that are identical in data but which might not have the same file name.

# Usage
`bindiff` (or `./bindiff`) - This will scan everything from your current directory and any subfolders.
`bindiff <some folder name>` - This will scan all files in a specific folder. As of right now, you can only scan one folder; spaces are part of that folder's name.
